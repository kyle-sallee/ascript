To provide accurate measurement
this simple 5 minute hack,
program timer.c,
was written.
Simple, small, no tricks, easily understood,
timer.c will suffice.

By ascript
a considerable ELF library plethora
is loaded.
In memory
where loaded
the performance
seems effected.

For comparison
from 20 tries
the lowest duration
should be used.

By
echo 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space
the duration fluctation
is somewhat mitigated.
However, not entirely eliminated.

With the BASH shell,
the performance
can not be measured.

By  the  BASH syntax builtin time
the sys  duration and
the real duration seem inaccurate.

By   "seem"
the  duration
when differently measured
different lower values become.
By   BASH
when measured
the  values are inflated.
Why?

The reason could be
a system specific problem,
a BASH bug,
or something entirely different.

Trust BASH or
trust function clock_gettime and
trust function getrusage?
Easy choice, yes?
