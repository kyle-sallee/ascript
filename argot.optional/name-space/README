For   traditional single    user   workstation   deployment
in    the         Linux     kernel configuration
the   namespace   support   might  not           be enabled.

For   development computers and
for   server      computers
in    the         Linux     kernel configuration
the   namespace   support          will          be enabled.

By    virtual     computers memory               is wasted.
By    namespaces            memory               is conserved.
While virtual     computers differ
many  similar     boons     become.
