Compared with
Linux default          security;
Linux capabilities are awesome!
If    a MAC, mandatory access control, such as TOMOYO is enabled;
Linux capabilities are useless!
A       MAC            awesomeness is 
Linux capabilities     awesomeness cubed!
With  a MAC        if  compared;
Linux capabilities are trash!
