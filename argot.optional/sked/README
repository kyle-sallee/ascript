Process    scheduling is a Linux specific task.
Anorexic   scheduling
gluttonous scheduling and
realtime   scheduling
is         possible.
The        names      differ,
but        the        idea
is         conveyed.

A computer can boot, hibernate, shutdown, reboot
and everything in between and
the sked is not required.

For  the  rare instances where scheduling is useful
sked      is   awesome,  better
than nice.
But  nice is simple
and  sked is complicated.
