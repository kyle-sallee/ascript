The   GNU C library  regular expression support     is  slow!
The   pcre2 library  is      awesome    and             fast!
To    pcre2 library  all     regular    expressions are delegated.
If    pcre2 library  is      not        installed
then  pcre2 library  can     not                    be  linked.
Bummer!

Sans  pcre2 library  dependent          argot
sans  optional/pcre2 directory
a     successful     compilation                    is  possible.
The   ascript        scripts
where reg *                             argot       are used
will  fail.
