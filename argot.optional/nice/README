The   POSIX  defined nice    is seldom useful.
On  a single core    CPU
for a long   running data    compression process
then  nice   is      useful.
To    hinder a       process cycle greedy user
then  nice   is      useful.

A computer can boot, hibernate, shutdown, reboot
and everything in between and
the nice is not required.
