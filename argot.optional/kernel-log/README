For  a   Linux kernel based POSIX
a        Linux kernel log   daemon   is      useful.
The      Linux kernel log            is   a  ring buffer.
When     capacity                    is      exceeded
then     by    newer  data
the            oldest data           is      replaced.

By   a   Linux kernel log   daemon
to       files the    data           is      sent.
Thus     the   oldest data           is  not lost.

Yet  at  boot
for  the Linux kernel log   capacity
if       insufficient
then     before
     a   Linux kernel log   daemon   is      started
the            oldest data           is      lost.
