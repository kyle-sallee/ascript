A     tty or
a     virtual console  are the same idea.

A     pts or
a     pseudo  terminal     appears to be a tty, but is not.
By    pts     a            descriptor pair          is provided.

To    a       terminal
afore         data     is  sent
for           data         logging
a     pts              is  used.
For           terminal     emulation
via   secure  socket       shell, ssh, or
via   an      X-server     client
a     PTS              is  used.

On    the     Linux        kernel    and
on            other        kernels
the   PTS     use          method    may differ.

If    init-script          logging
then  pts     type         variable  is  useful.
On    a       virtual      console
if    init-script          scrolling or  interacting
then  tty     type         variable  is  useful.

If    confused
then  pts     and
a     terminal equivalent bidirectional pipe is tantamount.
