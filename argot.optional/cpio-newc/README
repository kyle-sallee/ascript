A      computer   boot and
a      present    unwrapping are  similar.
While  required   parts      are  provided
some              assembly   is   required.

From   mass       storage devices
the    partition  tables  must be  read
the    file       systems must be  mounted, and
some   programs           must be  executed.

Sounds simple,    right?
Hardly.
From   a single   omission or
from   a single   mistake
the    computer   boot can fail.

The    computer   hardware     is  diverse.
For    mass       storage devices  alone
many              drivers exist.
Into   the        kernel
if     all        drivers      are compiled;
an     obese      kernel           becomes.
An     obese      kernel  does not load.

In  a  cpio       image
the    required   kernel  objects  can be placed.
The    cpio       image            can be compressed.
Into   the        kernel
if     linked;
an     obese      kernel  might    become.

The    above      obvious methods  are   least used.

The               kernel  objects  alone
do     not        suffice.
Some   programs,  a       C        library
and    scripts    also             are   useful.

Into   a          cpio    file
the    required   kernel  objects
the    required   file    system   files
can    be         aggregated.

By     the        kernel  boot     loader    program
the               kernel  image    and
the               cpio    file
can    be         loaded.

Into   the        kernel
if     a          decompression driver was compiled
then   the        cpio    file
can    be         compressed.

For    the        most    frequent method used
the    external   cpio    file            suffices.
Rather than       kernel  compilation     time
at     any                                time
the               cpio    file
can    be         created.

For               kernel  object    storage
the    linked in  cpio    file
can    be         used.
For    file       system  programs  and data
the    external   cpio    file
can    be         used.

By     the        above   paragraphs
an     initramfs,
an     initial    random  access memory file system was discussed.
For    Linux      kernel
for    most       boots
an     initramfs  is      required.

The  initramfs is a    cpio newc    format  file.
It   can       be      compressed   or
it   can       be sans compressed.
If   a         Linux   kernel       is  not used;
cpio newc      code                 is  not required.

cpio, copy     input   output,      was possibly intended?
From  several  formats
by    the      Linux   kernel
the   newc     format               is  required.
By    the      following shell command
the   cpio     formats   are   explained.
