To   enable
from ascript.optional/
to   ascript.enable/
a    C source file
can  be copied.

The  file bliss.c
the  file bold.c
are  recommended.

The  file stack.c
is   merely
for  testing.
The  stack rubbish buildup
when testing
the  stack size
when reduced
from underflow
a    segfault
is   more  rapidly solicited.

Unlike most C programs
by     ascript
by     ascript argot
the    stack   buildup
should not     become.

Temporary      data,
such   as      input,
for    storage
the    stack
is     not     used.
Data   addresses
code   addresses
on     the     stack
can    be      temporarily  stored.
Stack  overflow exploit opportunities
do     not     exist.
