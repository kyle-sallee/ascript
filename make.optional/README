To   enable
from make.optional/
to   make.enable/
a    Makefile fragment files
can  be copied.

Be   careful,
all  makefile fragments
must NOT be   enabled.

Ascript       compilation
and  a        supreme   pizza
entirely      differ!

By   the       ascript  author
the  file gz_no_got
is   used
is   highly recommended!

On   the same computer
when compiled
when executed
the  file     native
is   recommended!

On   64-bit architecture
the  32-bit ELFs
when required
the  file ia32
can  be   enabled.

For  smaller ELF files
the  file strip
can  be   enabled.
